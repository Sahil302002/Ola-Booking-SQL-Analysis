# Ola-Booking-SQL-Analysis
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Ola Bookings Dataset** to derive meaningful insights related to customer behavior, booking trends, and ride details. The analysis is done using SQL queries and views that explore various aspects of the dataset, including booking statuses, ride distances, cancellations, and payment methods. The main goal of this project is to explore, analyze, and present data-driven insights that can help improve operational efficiencies and customer satisfaction.

## Tasks

The primary tasks of this project include:

1. **Calculating the Total Number of Records**: Determine the overall size of the dataset.
2. **Identifying Successful Bookings**: Find the total number of successful bookings and retrieve relevant details.
3. **Analyzing Ride Distances**: Calculate the average ride distance for each vehicle type.
4. **Identifying Canceled Rides**: Track the total number of canceled rides by customers and drivers.
5. **Top Customers Analysis**: List the top 10 customers who booked the most rides.
6. **Driver Ratings Insights**: Calculate the maximum and minimum driver ratings for specific vehicle types.
7. **Payment Method Analysis**: Identify the number of rides paid using UPI.
8. **Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type**: Calculate the average customer rating for each vehicle type.
9. **Booking Value Analysis**: Calculate the total booking value of successful rides.
10. **Incomplete Rides**: Identify incomplete rides and the reasons for the same.

## SQL and Advanced SQL Functions Used

This project leverages several essential SQL functions and techniques, including:

- **Aggregate Functions**: `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` for summarizing data.
- **GROUP BY**: Used to group data by specific columns such as `Vehicle_Type` and `Customer_ID` for aggregation.
- **CASE Statements**: For conditional logic to categorize data such as canceled rides by reason.
- **CREATE VIEW**: To create reusable views for specific analyses such as successful bookings, canceled rides, and average ratings.
- **CAST and CONVERT**: For data type conversion to ensure numerical operations are accurate (e.g., converting `Ride_Distance` to a float for average calculation).
- **TOP (N)**: Used to limit results to the top N records based on certain conditions (e.g., top 10 customers with the highest rides).

## Insights

1. **Booking Success Rate**: The number of successful bookings provides a benchmark for understanding the overall performance of Ola's service.
2. **Ride Distances**: Vehicle types with the highest and lowest average ride distances can help optimize fleet management and identify potential areas for improvement.
3. **Canceled Rides**: Understanding the reasons for canceled rides can provide insights into customer and driver dissatisfaction, allowing Ola to address these issues proactively.
4. **Customer Behavior**: Identifying top customers who book the most rides can help tailor loyalty programs and improve customer retention.
5. **Driver Ratings**: The maximum and minimum driver ratings for specific vehicle types (e.g., Prime Sedan) can highlight areas for driver training and service improvement.
6. **Payment Preferences**: Analyzing the payment methods used by customers (e.g., UPI) can provide insights into customer preferences, guiding marketing and payment system optimizations.
7. **Customer Feedback**: Average ratings per vehicle type give insights into customer satisfaction and can help improve the quality of service across different vehicle types.
8. **Financial Insights**: The total booking value of successful rides gives an overall picture of the revenue generated from successful bookings.

## Recommendations

1. **Improved Fleet Management**: Optimize vehicle types based on the average ride distance to ensure the right vehicles are deployed for the right routes.
2. **Driver Training**: Based on driver ratings, specific areas of training can be identified, particularly for vehicle types that receive lower ratings.
3. **Cancellation Prevention**: Focus on reducing cancellations by addressing the primary reasons, especially if cancellations are driven by driver-related issues.
4. **Loyalty Programs**: Focus on retaining top customers by offering loyalty rewards or discounts based on their ride frequency.
5. **Payment System Optimization**: If UPI is the most commonly used payment method, Ola can enhance the UPI payment system for a smoother user experience.
6. **Enhance Customer Experience**: The average ratings by vehicle type suggest that customer satisfaction varies by vehicle type, and improvements can be made in those areas to increase overall ratings.
